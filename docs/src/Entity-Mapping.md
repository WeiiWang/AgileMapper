Mapping to entities - an object with a member decorated with a [`KeyAttribute`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.componentmodel.dataannotations.keyattribute) - uses a couple of extra rules. 

### Entity Keys

By default, members decorated with a `KeyAttribute` are not mapped, unless the mapping is a deep clone. Entity key values are usually generated by a data store, and some ORMs will ignore key value updates, or in some cases, throw an exception.

If you need to map `KeyAttribute` members, you can [configure the behaviour](/configuration/Entity-Mapping) that suits your needs, or configure a [custom data source](/configuration/Member-Values).

### Optional Related Entity Keys

A nullable numeric member named **<something>Id** will not be mapped to zero if the target type also has a **<something>** Entity-type member.

For example:

```cs
class CategoryDto
{
    public int? Id { get; set; }
    public int? ParentId { get; set; }
    public int? TopProductId { get; set; }
}

class Category
{
    [Key]
    public int? Id { get; set; }

    public int? ParentId { get; set; }

    public Category Parent { get; set; }

    public int? TopProductId { get; set; }
}
```

When mapping from a `CategoryDto` to a `Category`:

- `Category.Id` will not be mapped, because it is an entity key member

- `Category.ParentId` will not be mapped to 0, because `Category` has a `Parent` member

- `Category.TopProductId` will be mapped to 0, because `Category` has no `TopProduct` member
